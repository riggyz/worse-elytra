# Balanced Elytra


## TODOS
TODO: make it so that the elytra texture is masked over so that it looks like it degreds as the elytra is used
TODO: remove deprecated code and clean up the file structure
TODO: make it so that the name of the elytra reflects the state
TODO: write some good lore text so that the user can infer what each elytra state does
TODO: test with cape textures + curios
TODO: make the elytra commands require op and remove some of them (like repair, etc) OR hide them behind a flag
