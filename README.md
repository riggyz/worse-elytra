# Worse Elytra
Elytras as they are in vanilla have a problem for modded transportation - they are too good. All they cost is some rockets or mana to fly and repairing them is trivial with mending. This leaves cool transport methods like Create trains and VS2 Blimps a less attractive form of transport. So this mod aims to nerf the elytra in a way that does not remove the short distance flights, but severely hampers long range flight.

This repo used the [template] repo created and maintined by jaredlll08. Without it I would have no idea where to start with a multiloader mod.
