# Worse Elytra
Elytras as they are in vanilla have a problem for modded transportation - they are too good. All they cost is some rockets or mana to fly and repairing them is trivial with mending. This leaves cool transport methods like Create trains and VS2 Blimps a less attractive form of transport. So this mod aims to nerf the elytra in a way that does not remove the short distance flights, but severely hampers long range flight.

## Mechanics
### Damage Stages
Like an anvil, an elytra will now have several item stages. As the elytra are used your normal durability decreases, but before the durability reaches zero the item will **degrade** into a lower stage. Each stage gets progressively worse until the wings finally break and need repaired.

The stats affected by stage are as follows:
- Durability
- Air resistance
- Flight duration
- Cooldown duration

> **NOTE:** While mending will work for normal durability, stages can only be repaired with phantom membranes!

### Flight Exhaustion
As a sort of hard cap, now the elytra will keep track of the total flight time and if it exceeds a certain distance they will become exhausted. While wings are exhausted cannot fly and will be on cooldown.

### Visual Damage
If you manage to break your elytra, other players will know about it!

## Notes
While I think this mod is feature complete, the features have not been bug tested and tuned to what I would like. I will also be adding some configs so you can tweak it yourself and mod compat information once I get around to it.
